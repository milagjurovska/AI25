## Python for Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my codes for Laboratory exercises and Midterm exercises for the subject Artificial Intelligence.

1st laboratory exercises - <b>uninformed serching</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>Snake game, where the snake needs to collect the green apples and stay away frow the red ones.</li>
  <li>Football game, where an attacker needs to kick the ball into the goal, but the ball can't get within one field of the static defenders.</li>
</ul>
  
  
2nd laboratory exercises - <b>informed searching</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>Game where a person wants to get to his moving house and is only allowed to go on certain fields.</li>
  <li>Game where a person wants to get to his house, but can't go directly on certain fields and can't jump over them.</li>
</ul>
  
 
3rd laboratory exercises - <b>Naive-Bayes classifier</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>Training a Naive Bayes classifier using a categorical dataset for a solar flare.</li>
  <li>Training a Naive Bayes classifier using a continuous dataset for cryotherapy. </li>
</ul>

4th laboratory exercises - <b>Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>Training a Decision Tree classifier using a categorical dataset for a solar flare.</li>
  <li>Training a Random Forest classifier using a continuous dataset for attributes of fish.</li>
</ul>
